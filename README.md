# 👋 Hi, I'm Maha!

**🎓 Junior at University of Texas at Dallas, studying Computer Science**          
**🔭 Aspiring AI/ML engineer**

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. I’m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. (Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a [Break Through Tech Fellow](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/) !) Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data science. I’m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!

### 🎯 Featured Project: Synthetic-to-Real Object Detection Benchmark
- **What We Did:** Boosted YOLO11n by +0.30 mAP@50 (3× target) using synthetic + real data, audited 10%+ noisy annotations, ran hyperparameter & augmentation experiments, and collected 200+ real-world test images—reducing synthetic-to-real domain gap and producing a high-quality, consistent dataset.
- **Tech stack:** Python, scikit-learn, Ultralytics YOLO, Google Colab, CSV/JSON (data handling), PIL (image processing), tqdm (progress tracking)
- **Key learnings:** Combining synthetic + real data improves generalization, annotation quality impacts performance, structured experiments enhance robustness

### ✨ Fun Fact:
I taught myself calligraphy from scratch! One artwork even took me two months to finish, all drawn completely freehand—no special pens, no templates, just pure creativity.
